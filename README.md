You need [vitasdk](https://vitasdk.org/).

Run "create_vpk.sh" to build a package.

Firmware specific offsets are in first.c and nsbl.h.

The source is for advanced users only. Users should download the [prebuilt package](https://github.com/SKGleba/enso/releases/latest). If something goes wrong, you WILL perma-brick your Vita. There is no recovery, even if you have a hardware mod. The only possible recovery is if you have a hardware mod and you dump the eMMC _before_ getting bricked, then you can restore the dump. Dumps are device-specific and encrypted with a device-specific key.

Again, even if you just add a custom boot logo, there's a good chance you will perma-brick your Vita. You have been warned.
